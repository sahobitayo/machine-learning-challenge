# machine-learning-challenge

## Background
This project explores different machine learning models to determine which may be best to identify exoplanets from NASA data.

This repository contains three Jupyter notebooksâ€”one per model with the exception of the linear regression model also found [here](https://github.com/sahobitayo/machine-learning-challenge/blob/master/decision%20_tree.ipynb) and copy of the source data in CSV format. If you'd like to experiment with these notebooks, simply git clone or download this repo to a computer that has pandas, scikit-learn, and Jupyter installed.

## Preparing Models
- Determined feature importances by running Decision Tree and Random Forest models. The features that showed the most promise were: `koi_fpflag_co`, `koi_fpflag_nt`, `koi_fpflag_ss`, `koi_model_snr`, `koi_prad`, `koi_prad_err2`, `koi_duration_err2`.
- Used the features to train the K Nearest Neighbors and SVC models.
- Used `GridSearchCV` to hypertune the models and boost performance.
- Tested the models (adding and removing features, running model with and without GridSearchCV) to confirm that feature selection was appropriate.
